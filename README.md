### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Spark driver failure incident.
---

Apache Spark driver failure refers to an incident where the driver program in an Apache Spark cluster fails to execute or crashes during runtime. This can happen due to a variety of reasons such as hardware failure, software bugs, resource constraints, or programming errors. As the driver program is responsible for coordinating the execution of tasks across the cluster, any failure in the driver can result in the entire Spark job failing. This can lead to data loss, processing delays, and impact the overall performance of the Spark cluster.

### Parameters
```shell
export DRIVER_PROCESS_ID="PLACEHOLDER"

export MAX_CPU_USAGE_ALLOWED="PLACEHOLDER"

export MIN_FREE_MEM_REQUIRED="PLACEHOLDER"

export DRIVER_NODE_MOUNT_POINT="PLACEHOLDER"

export MIN_FREE_DISK_SPACE_REQUIRED="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_SPARK_DEFAULTS_CONF="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_DRIVER_MEMORY="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Step 1: Check if Apache Spark is running
```shell
sudo systemctl status spark | grep -q "Active: active (running)" || echo "Apache Spark is not running"
```

### Step 2: Check the logs for error messages
```shell
sudo tail -n 100 /var/log/spark/spark-driver.log
```

### Step 4: Check the resource allocation of the driver
```shell
sudo ps -ef | grep ${DRIVER_PROCESS_ID}
```

### Step 5: Check the available resources on the cluster
```shell
sudo free -m
```

### Step 6: Check if there are any network issues
```shell
sudo netstat -tuln
```

### Step 3: Check the status of the Apache Spark driver
```shell
sudo jps | grep -q "Driver" || echo "Apache Spark driver is not running"
```

### Step 7: Check the configuration files for any errors
```shell
sudo cat /etc/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf | grep -i error

sudo cat /etc/spark/conf/spark-env.sh | grep -i error
```

### Insufficient resources (RAM, disk space, CPU) available for Apache Spark driver.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Check available RAM on the driver node

free_mem=$(free -m | awk '/^Mem/ {print $4}')

if [[ $free_mem -lt ${MIN_FREE_MEM_REQUIRED} ]]; then

    echo "ERROR: Insufficient free memory available on driver node."

fi



# Check available disk space on the driver node

free_space=$(df -h ${DRIVER_NODE_MOUNT_POINT} | awk '/^\/dev/ {print $4}')

if [[ $free_space -lt ${MIN_FREE_DISK_SPACE_REQUIRED} ]]; then

    echo "ERROR: Insufficient free disk space available on driver node."

fi



# Check CPU usage on the driver node

cpu_usage=$(top -b -n 1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2+$4}')

if [[ $cpu_usage -gt ${MAX_CPU_USAGE_ALLOWED} ]]; then

    echo "ERROR: High CPU usage detected on driver node."

fi


```

## Repair

### Increase the resources allocated to the Apache Spark driver to prevent future failures.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the path to the Spark configuration file

SPARK_CONF=${PATH_TO_SPARK_DEFAULTS_CONF}



# Set the new value for the Spark driver memory

NEW_DRIVER_MEMORY=${NEW_DRIVER_MEMORY}



# Update the spark.driver.memory configuration in spark-defaults.conf

sed -i "s/^spark.driver.memory\s*=.*$/spark.driver.memory $NEW_DRIVER_MEMORY/g" $SPARK_CONF


```
